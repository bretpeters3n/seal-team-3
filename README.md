cd seal-team-3
```

3. Change the working directory again

cd client
```

4. Install dependencies (frontend)

```bash
npm install
```

5. Back out one directory

```bash
cd ..
```

6. Change the working directory yet again

```bash
cd server
```

7. Install dependencies (backend)

```bash
npm install
```

8. Create `.env` file in 'server' and add a variable

```bash
SECRET_KEY='whatever secret key here'
```
